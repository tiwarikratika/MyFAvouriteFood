<h2>What is REACT.JS ?</h2>

<p>React. js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications.
It is used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. 
React also allows us to create reusable UI components. </p>


<h2>Why ReactJS?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>React is Flexible</li>
  <li>React Has a Great Developer Experience</li>
  <li>React Has Facebook's Support/Resources</li>
  <li>React Has Broader Community Support</li>
  <li>React Has Great Performance</li>
  <li>React is Easy to Test</li>

</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites for REACTJS</h2>
<ol>
  <li>HTML and CSS</li>
  <li>Fundamentals of Javascript and ES6
 </li>
  <li>JSX (Javascript XML) : You don't really need to be fluent with this.
  There is not much difference between Javascript and JSX. Knowing Javascript basics ,
  we can easily learn JSX while writing React code.</li>  
  <li>Package Manager (Node + Npm) </li>
  <li>Git and Github : Knowing these is always a benefit as 
  it makes it easy to contribute to your open source projects</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to set up Package manager (Node + NPM)</h2>

<h3>What is Node</h3>

<p>Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer
process itself instead of in a browser. 
Node can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access
to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build
fully-functional applications.

Node.js is written in C, C++, and JavaScript, and it is built on the 
open-source V8 JavaScript engine </p>

<h3>What is npm?</h3>

<p>npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. 
It puts modules in place so that node can find them,
and manages dependency conflicts intelligently</p>

<h3>To install node</h3>

<ol>
<li>Download Node.js Installer</li>
Go to  https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and click the Windows
Installer button to download the latest default version.
The Node.js installer includes the NPM package manager.

<li>After dowloading, install it on your computer</li>

<li>Verify installation</li>

    node -v
The system should display the Node.js version installed on your system.
 
    npm -v
The system should display the npm version installed on your system.

</ol>

<h3>How to create your first react app</h3>
